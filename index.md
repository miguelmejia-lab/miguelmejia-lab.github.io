Hello, I'm a computer engineering major at CSUF and I plan to graduate on 2029.

# Favorite CPSC 120L Lab Projects

* Lab 4, part 1

This lab was about changing milliliters to U.S. customary units using modular programming and careful floating-point calculations. I liked working on breaking the problem into smaller functions and testing each part step by step. Fixing compile and logic errors helped me improve my code, and it felt good to see my team's program give correct results. My favorite part was actually running the test cases with my lab partner and having my output match the expected values.

* Lab 5

This laboratory project was designed for students to apply the concepts of modular programming and debugging while solving practical problems. The first part of the lab was about learning to calculate the area of a rectangle using functions, where I also got introduced to the idea of test-driven development through unit tests. It made me understand coding in a much better way. In the second part, I had to convert decimal feet to feet and inches using truncation coding. My favorite part was learning how to improve my code to pass all tests and seeing everything work was very satisfying!

* Lab 6, part 1

This lab was about designing a program that would handle sandwich orders via command line input, and this lab was my most favorite. I learned how to validate inputs and then build sentences such as "A ham sandwich on rye with mayo." Debugging input validation was more difficult but rewarding to catch such an error as missing or extra arguments. The best part of the code was when the program started generating correct output for the test cases it was very amusing to see the silly sandwich orders my team came up with. This lab helped me comprehend how the command-line argument processing goes in C++.
